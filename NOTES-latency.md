# Measured `GET /v1/context` latency

*(Originally written as acceptance criterion AC7 of [SodaMem
#9](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem/issues/9), the issue this plugin was
built under. "AC7" below refers to that.)*

Recall sits on the synchronous path between the user pressing enter and the
first token, and the SodaMem daemon runs `--workers 1` by design ([SodaMem ADR
0001 §2](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-control-plane-db.md)
— single worker is a correctness constraint there, not a performance choice). So the
1500 ms recall deadline is set from a measurement, not a hope.

**Every number in this file was produced by a run against a live daemon backed
by a real, populated store. Nothing here is estimated.** (An earlier pass could
only measure an empty store and said so; that floor is superseded and has been
removed.)

## How the store was built — no LLM key required

The first pass reported AC7 as blocked: `POST /v1/memories` refuses every write
without an extractor, so with no `SODAMEM_LLM_API_KEY` there was nothing to
measure against. That blocker was soluble. `sodamem.llm.testing.ScriptedProvider`
feeds `FactEventExtractorV2` a pre-set response per call, which drives the
**real** ingest path — real fact rows, real source spans, real entity roles,
real MiniLM embeddings from the cached model — with **zero LLM network calls**.

Build script: `scripts/populate_store.py <data_root> <user_id> <n_facts>`.

**Precondition.** That script is Python and imports `sodamem` internals
(`sodamem.llm.testing.ScriptedProvider`, `sodamem.memory.ingest.extractor`).
This repo is a TypeScript package and does not ship or install it, so
`populate_store.py` cannot run from a bare checkout of this repo. Reproducing
the store — and therefore the measurement — requires a
[SodaMem](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem) checkout with the Python package
installed (`pip install -e ".[dev,chroma,server,llm]"`). The two `.mjs` probe
scripts have no such dependency: they speak plain HTTP to a running daemon and
run on Node alone.

Resulting store:

| | |
|---|---|
| `fact_events` | 1000 |
| `source_spans` | 1000 |
| `raw_turns` | 1000 |
| chroma `embeddings` | 3000 |
| on disk | 23 MB |

The generator rotates four predicate families (`travel_by_airline`,
`employed_by`, `owns_pet`, `resides_in`) across 12 cities, 6 airlines, 6
employers, and 5 pets, so retrieval has genuine competition to rank rather than
N copies of one fact.

Daemon: `sodamem daemon ensure`, auth **enabled**, `--workers 1`, on
`127.0.0.1:8771`.

## Sequential — one client, 200 requests

`node scripts/measure-context-latency.mjs 200`, with these six store-relevant
queries supplied via `SODAMEM_QUERIES` (`|`-separated) rather than the script's
generic built-in set:

```
where do I live?
which airline did I fly to Boston?
where do I work now?
do I have a pet?
what city did I move to?
tell me about my flights
```

`token_budget` 1200, one warm-up request excluded. The concurrency probe uses
the same six (the `QUERIES` array in `scripts/concurrency_probe.mjs`).

| metric | ms |
|---|---|
| min | 112 |
| **p50** | **182.6** |
| p95 | 323 |
| **p99** | **471.1** |
| max | 596.4 |

Read this as: auto-injection adds roughly 180 ms to time-to-first-token on a
typical turn and about 470 ms at the tail. Noticeable, not disqualifying — and
because `/v1/context` is the zero-LLM path, this cost does not grow with model
spend.

**This table is the trustworthy absolute number in this file.**

## Concurrent — the `--workers 1` question

The sequential table describes one client. The real deployment is a dsh turn
racing a Cursor hook and a Claude Code hook against the same single worker.
Probe: `node scripts/concurrency_probe.mjs`, 5 rounds per level.

| concurrency | n | median ms | worst-of-n ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 338.3 | 400.8 |
| 2 | 10 | 491.1 | 532.4 |
| 4 | 20 | 603.4 | 816.7 |
| 8 | 40 | 1179.3 | 1379.1 |

It queues, roughly linearly.

### Caveat — the right-hand column is a maximum, not a p99

The probe labels that column `p99`, and at these sample sizes that label is
wrong. Its percentile helper resolves `p99` to
`sorted[ceil(0.99 * n) - 1]`, which for n = 5, 10, 20, and 40 is `sorted[n-1]`
— the **largest sample**, every time. So the concurrency-8 figure of 1379.1 ms
is the worst of 40 requests, not a 99th percentile, and a single sample does
not deserve to be quoted to a tenth of a millisecond.

The column is relabelled here to say what the number actually is. The median
column is a genuine (lower) median at every level and is unaffected.

### Caveat — do not read these as absolute milliseconds

The probe's numbers run **higher** than the 200-iteration sequential harness at
equivalent load: 338 ms median at concurrency 1 against 182.6 ms sequential.
That gap is measurement artifact, not a finding. Five rounds do not warm the
BM25 index cache the way 200 sequential requests do, so the probe pays
cold-cache cost throughout.

The reliable output of the probe is the **shape** — near-linear queueing under
concurrency. For absolute latency, use the sequential table.

### Caveat — scope of the whole measurement

One machine, over loopback, against one store profile (1000 facts, the four
synthetic predicate families above). Different hardware, a real network hop, a
larger or differently-shaped store, or a different query mix will move these
numbers. Nothing here has been reproduced on a second machine.

## Operational consequence — state this plainly

**At concurrency 8, the slowest of 40 requests took 1379 ms — inside 10% of the
plugin's 1500 ms recall deadline.** Enough concurrent clients and recall starts
missing that deadline.

How firm is that margin? Deliberately not very, and in the pessimistic
direction. The 1379 ms is one worst-case sample out of 40, measured on a
cold BM25 cache that the caveats above show reads high — the same probe
overstates concurrency-1 latency by roughly 1.9x against the sequential
harness. So "within 10% of the deadline" is a **conservative bound, not a
precise measurement**: the real margin at concurrency 8 is very likely wider
than 121 ms, and the median request at that level (1179 ms) still cleared the
deadline. Treat it as "the ceiling is close enough to matter", not as "recall
fails at 8 clients".

What is *not* softened by any of that is the direction and the shape: latency
grows near-linearly with concurrent clients, and the deadline is a fixed
1500 ms. Somewhere in the region the probe is pointing at, recall starts
dropping — the uncertainty is in exactly where, not in whether.

When it does drop, the plugin does the safe thing: it caches `''`, contributes
no memory, and the turn proceeds normally. Nothing breaks and nothing blocks.

But **the failure is silent.** There is no error surfaced to the user and no
degraded turn — memory simply, quietly, stops working under multi-client load.
A deployment that adds a third or fourth concurrent SodaMem client can lose
recall entirely without anyone noticing that anything changed. That is the
property to watch, and it is why the plugin logs a warning on every degraded
turn (`ctx.logger.warn`) even though it never raises.

## The concurrency ceiling is not a plugin defect

The read path not scaling past a handful of concurrent clients is a **SodaMem
daemon property**: one worker by design ([SodaMem ADR 0001
§2](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-control-plane-db.md)),
pre-existing, and
entirely independent of this plugin.

What this plugin changes is **reachability**. Over the MCP bridge, `/v1/context`
was an occasional tool call the model had to choose to make. Auto-injection
makes it a *per-turn* call on every turn of every agent. The same ceiling that
was previously hard to reach is now reached by ordinary use with a few clients
attached.

That deserves its own issue against the daemon's read concurrency. It is
**explicitly out of scope for [SodaMem
#9](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem/issues/9)**, the issue this plugin was
built under — this plugin's job is to degrade safely
when the ceiling is hit, which it does and which is tested.

## Reproducing

All four scripts live in this repo, under `scripts/`, and the commands below
are written from this repo's root. Step 1 additionally needs the `sodamem`
**Python** package importable — install it from a
[SodaMem](https://github.com/SodaMem/SodaMem) checkout first (see the
precondition above). Steps 2–4 need only Node and a reachable daemon.

```sh
# 1. Build a real store, no LLM key needed.
#    Requires the sodamem Python package on sys.path.
python scripts/populate_store.py <data_root> <user_id> 1000

# 2. Start the daemon on that store.
sodamem daemon ensure --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8771 \
  --api-key <key> --data-root <data_root>

# 3. Sequential latency.
SODAMEM_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8771 SODAMEM_API_KEY=<key> \
SODAMEM_USER_ID=<user_id> SODAMEM_QUERIES='where do I live?|where do I work now?' \
  node scripts/measure-context-latency.mjs 200

# 4. Concurrency shape.
SODAMEM_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8771 SODAMEM_API_KEY=<key> \
SODAMEM_USER_ID=<user_id> node scripts/concurrency_probe.mjs
